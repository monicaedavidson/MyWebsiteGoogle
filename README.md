This code is built for the assignment called "Rebuild a site." The collaborators are Monica Davidson, who created the code and Dexter Lesaca who helped with the HTML5 layout. 

This code is designed to mimic the website "www.google.com". The header contains "+You" which links to Google Apps, "Gmail" which links to Google Mail, "Images" which links to Google Images and lastly, for time-saving purposes (and I don't know how to create that code!) a link to Gmail appears again through my personal e-mail.

Below the header contains the article which holds the main Google search terminal.

At the bottom of the website is the footer which contains a link to Google Advertising, Business, About, Privacy and Terms and Settings.
